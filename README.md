A package of .bash and .sql scripts for MSSQL for linux to automate the process of creating backups of all databases running on SQL Server and automatically generated .sql queries needed to restore them. The included scripts support differential and full backups, and the scripts that restore databases from copies can set them to norecovery or recovery mode.
The main application, is a complete backup with automatic recovery procedure.
The second application is to implement a mirror of two or more SQL servers by automatically uploading differential backups of all running databases to the backup server.
(E.g. between MSSQL Server for Linux and for Windows )

I used scripts by Paul Hewson:

https://www.sqlserversnippets.com/2013/10/generate-scripts-to-attach-multiple.html

Greg Robidoux:

https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/1070/simple-script-to-backup-all-sql-server-databases/

A working example:
	Path to scripts: /root/scripts/
	Crontab file:
	{
SHELL=/bin/bash

PATH=/etc:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/root/scripts

0 23 * * * /root/scripts/copy_mdf.sh /srv/data/

30 23 * * * /root/scripts/gensql.sh attach /srv/data/ > /srv/data/attachall.sql

5 0 * * 0  rm /srv/backup/*.bak;rm /srv/backup/*.BAK; /root/scripts/backupall.sh -f /srv/backup/>> /root/scripts/cron.log;/root/scripts/gensql.sh restore /srv/backup/ norecovery > /srv/backup/restoreall.sql;rm /srv/backup/diff/*.bak; rm /srv/backup/diff/*.BAK

0 10,12,14,16,18,20,22 * * 1-7 /root/scripts/backupall.sh /srv/backup/diff/ >>/root/scripts/cron.log;/root/scripts/gensql.sh restore /srv/backup/diff/ norecovery >/srv/backup/diff/restoreall.sql;gensql.sh setrecovery /srv/backup/diff/ recovery >/srv/backup/diff/setrecoveryall.sql 

	}
	
Crontab description:
	
	1. every day at 23:00 copy_mdf.sh stops SQL Server and copies all database files *.mdf, *.ldf to /srv/data/ 
	
    2. every day at 23:30 after restart sql server generate script attachall.sql placed with copied data half an hour earlier.
		
	3. once a week on Sunday 00:05:00 backupall.sh does a full backup (-f) of the running databases to /srv/backup/ and generates the restoreall.sql query needed to restore them placing it with the backups folder. After which it removes the old differential copies from the /srv/backup/diff/*.bak directory
	
	4. every two hours every day from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. backupall.sh creates differential copies (no -f) of all the databases in /srv/backup/diff/ and generates the restoreall.sql query needed to restore them with the NORECOVERY parameter (-r) and setrecoveryall.sql -script for swith 'databases for recovery state. 
	
The scenario of fully restoring the databases from a .bak copy consists of three stages: 

Stage 1: running an automatically generated .sql query restoreall.sql for recovery databases from .bak for FULL copies:
    
	/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'Passwordofsql' -i /srv/backups/restoreall.sql
	
	(Full copies, so the databases recovered in the first stage will be NORECOVERY. Since we assume that there are still differential copies waiting to be restored

{automatically generated by backupall.sh}

	RESTORE DATABASE[AUTOPARTNER] FROM DISK = '/srv/backup/AUTOPARTNER.bak' WITH NORECOVERY,
	
	REPLACE, STATS = 5
	
	RESTORE DATABASE[KR_L_WOJCIECH_LURK] FROM DISK = '/srv/backup/KR_L_WOJCIECH_LURK.bak' WITH NORECOVERY,
	
	REPLACE, STATS = 5


Stage 2: running an automatically generated .sql query restoreall.sql From Differential Copies:
    
	/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'Passwordofsql' -i /srv/backups/diff/restoreall.sql
	
	The recovered databases in the second stage will be NORECOVERY (perheps to the next tasks of recovery )
	
     {automatically generated by backupall.sh}
	 
	RESTORE DATABASE[AUTOPARTNER] FROM DISK = '/srv/backup/diff/AUTOPARTNER.bak' WITH RECOVERY,
	
	REPLACE, STATS = 5
	
	RESTORE DATABASE[KR_L_WOJCIECH_LURK] FROM DISK = '/srv/backup/diff/KR_L_WOJCIECH_LURK.bak' WITH NORECOVERY,
	
	REPLACE, STATS = 5
	
Stage 3: running an automatically generated query setrecoveryall.sql for switch all databases into RECOVERY state.

The alternative scenario appends to sql server all previously copied .mdf and.ldf files to the bases folder:
 
	Copy the .mdf and .ldf to the correct mssql data folder, then set correct linux  user and group for mssql server in linux:

	cp /srv/data/* /var/opt/mssql/data
	
	chown mssql /var/opt/mssql/data/*.BAK
	
	chown mssql /var/opt/mssql/data/*.LDF
	
	chgrp mssql /var/opt/mssql/data/*.BAK
	
	chgrp mssql /var/opt/mssql/data/*.LDF
	
running an automatically generated .sql query that performs ATTACH for every databases: 

	/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'Passwordofsql' -i /srv/data/attachall.sql
	
{automatically generated by copy_mdf.sh}:

CREATE DATABASE [AUTOPARTNER] ON

( FILENAME = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/AUTOPARTNER.mdf' ),

( FILENAME = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/AUTOPARTNER_log.ldf' )

 FOR ATTACH
 
CREATE DATABASE [KR_L_WOJCIECH_LURK] ON

( FILENAME = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/KR_L_WOJCIECH_LURK.mdf' ),

( FILENAME = N'/var/opt/mssql/data/KR_L_WOJCIECH_LURK_log.ldf' )
